        <div id="tab-1" class="tab-content current">
            <h2>Tab One</h2>

          <p>The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone. If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself. Put another log on the fire for me, I've made some breakfast and coffee. Turn to the right! I'm afraid of Americans. I kissed a lot of people that day. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Tab Two</h2>

          <p>I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean. You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it. We believe in you. The far side of town, where the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground. It's a moving world, but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles. Tell my wife I love her very much. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Tab Three</h2>

          <p>If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself. If she says she can do it, then she can do it, she don't make false claims. Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. Don't kid yourself they belong to you, they're the start of a coming race. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? </p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab-4" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Tab Four</h2>

            <p>I've never done good things. If you want it, boys, get it here. Strange, mad celebration. The return of the Thin White Duke. We must have died alone, a long long time ago. They're travelling the holy land opening telegrams. Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings. </p>
